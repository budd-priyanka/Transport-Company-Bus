A bus travel fare summarizer
A well-designed application that allows bus drivers for Mild Atlantic Bus Tours to enter their
name, the number of discounted, student and full-fare passengers that they have carried on their tours
that day. The fares for Mild Atlantic Bus Tours are €5.50 for a full-fare passenger, €4.50 for a student
and €3.75 for a discount fare passenger. Calculate data for a driver including total riders, total receipts and average receipts per rider and
display this data, along with the driver’s name in a group box. This group box should not be visible
prior to calculating the driver summary data, and should not be visible when the data are cleared to
allow a new user to enter data, or when company-wide summary data is displayed. Use currency
formatting to display the results in euros.
